<h2>Sample Questions - Basic Web Techniques</h2>

<h3>Word Wide Web General</h3>
<p><strong>What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
    <li>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</li>
    <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
    <li>Web Browsers</li>
    <li>Domain Name System (DNS)</li>
    <li>Search Engines</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
    <li>Web Servers and Databases</li>
    <li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and HTTPS</li>
    <li>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</li>
    <li>Responsive Design and Mobile Web Technologies</li>
    <li>APIs and Web Services (REST, SOAP)</li>
    <li>Social Media and User-Generated Content Platforms</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How are resources (html pages, images, etc. ) addressed in the web?</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>are addressed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)</li>
    <li>provide a standardized way the location of each resource</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>What are the general components of an url?</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Protocol</strong>: Specifies the communication method, usually http or https.</li>
    <li><strong>Domain</strong>: The server's address (e.g., example.com).</li>
    <li><strong>Port (optional)</strong>: The server's port, defaulting to 80 for http and 443 for https (e.g., :8080).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Path</strong>: The specific location of the resource on the server (e.g., /images/photo.jpg).</li>
    <li><strong>Query (optional)</strong>: Key-value pairs for dynamic content, starting with ? (e.g., ?search=web).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fragment (optional)</strong>: A section within the resource, starting with # (e.g., #section1).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Web Server</h3>

<p><strong>What is a web server?</strong></p>
<p>A web server is a computer system or software that hosts websites and serves web content to users over
    the internet. It receives requests from clients (like browsers), processes them, and delivers the requested
    resources—such as HTML pages, images, or data—via HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Examples include Apache,
    Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.</p>

<p><strong>What does a web server?</strong></p>
<p> A web server is a computer system or software that hosts websites and serves web content to users over
    the internet. It receives requests from clients (like browsers), processes them, and delivers the
    requested resources—such as HTML pages, images, or data—via HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Examples include
    Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.</p>
<p><strong>How can content be stored on a web server?</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Static Files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, and documents are stored as files directly on the
        server’s file system. These files are served exactly as they are, with no modifications.
    </li>

    <li>Databases: Dynamic content, such as user data, product information, and posts, is stored in databases
        like MySQL, PostgreSQL,
        or MongoDB. The web server retrieves this data based on user requests, often
        generating pages dynamically.
    </li>

    <li>Content Management Systems (CMS): Systems like WordPress or Drupal store content in a database and allow
        easy management and publishing of content via a user-friendly interface.
    </li>

    <li>Cloud Storage: Some content, especially large files like media, may be stored in cloud storage (e.g.,
        AWS S3) and accessed via URLs, reducing load on the main web server.
    </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How is content in webpages described?</strong></p>
<p>Content in webpages is described using HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
    HTML structures the content with elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists, defining
    the layout and meaning of the information. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format the
    HTML elements, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the content.</p>

<h2>Web Client</h2>
<p><strong>What is a web client?</strong></p>
<p>A web client is a software or device, typically a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox), that
    requests and displays content from a web server. It sends HTTP requests for resources (like web
    pages or images) and renders the response for the user to interact with.

<p><strong>What does a web client?</strong></p>
<p>A web client is a software or device that requests and displays content from a web server. It
    typically sends HTTP requests to retrieve resources like web pages, images, or data, and then
    renders the content for the user to interact with. Common web clients include web browsers (like
    Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and apps that use web-based content.</p>

<p><strong>Web Client and Web Browser is the same?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>While web client and web browser are closely related, they are not exactly the same:</li>

    <li>Web Client: Refers to any software or device that interacts with a web server to request and display
        web content. A web client can be a web browser, but it could also be other types of applications
        (e.g., mobile apps or command-line tools) that request web resources.
    </li>

    <li>Web Browser: A specific type of web client, like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge, that is designed
        to request, retrieve, and display web content (HTML, images, videos, etc.) from web servers.
    </li>

    <li>In short, all web browsers are web clients, but not all web clients are web browsers.</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Hello World</em></h2>
<p><strong>What is the html head element?</strong></p>

<p> &lt;head&gt; element in HTML contains meta-information about the webpage, such as the title,
    character encoding, links to stylesheets, and scripts. It does not display content
    on the page but provides essential data for the browser and search engines.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>What does &lt;!DOCTYPE` html&gt; mean?
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is a declaration that tells the browser the document type and version of
        HTML being used. In this case, &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; specifies that the page is written in
        HTML5. It helps the browser render the page correctly by ensuring it follows the rules
        and syntax of HTML5.
    </li>
    <li>What are the two top most elements within the html element?
        The two topmost elements within the
        &lt;html&gt element are:

        &lthead&gt;: Contains meta-information about the document, like the title, links to
        stylesheets, and scripts, but does not display content on the page.
        &ltbody&gt;: Contains the actual content of the webpage that is displayed to the user, such
        as text, images, and other media.
    </li>
    <li> 4. How to emphasize a text and how is it displayed in the browser?
        To emphasize text in HTML, you can use the &lt;em&gt; tag. This tag typically displays the
        text in italic in most browsers by default.
        In the browser, the word "important" would appear in italics, indicating emphasis.
    </li>
    <li> 5. How to mark up important ext and how is it displayed in the browser?
        To mark up important text in HTML, you can use the &lt;strong&gt; tag. This tag typically
        displays the text in bold in most browsers by default.
        In the browser, the phrase "very important" will appear in bold, indicating that it
        carries strong emphasis or importance.
    </li>
